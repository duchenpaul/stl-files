Thanks so much for purchasing this download and for supporting the JBV Creative Studio!

I have improved my file layout so all you have to do is drop all the files into 
your slicer and hit print.  If you would like to mix up the colour scheme 
(which I highly recommend XD) there is a parts list below so you can make
sure you have everything you need.

If you have any questions or need any help while printing or assembling this piece, 
please do not hesitate to reach out to me at jbvcreative@gmail.com
